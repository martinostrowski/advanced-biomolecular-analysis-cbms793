<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>At a high level, computers do four things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>run programs</li>
  <li>store data</li>
  <li>communicate with each other, and</li>
  <li>interact with us</li>
</ul>

<p>They can do the last of these in many different ways,
including through a keyboard and mouse, or touch screen interfaces, or using speech recognition systems.
While touch and voice interfaces are becoming more commonplace, most interaction is still
done using traditional screens, mice, touchpads and keyboards.</p>

<p>We are all familiar with <strong>graphical user interfaces</strong> (GUI): windows, icons and pointers.
They are easy to learn and fantastic for simple tasks where a vocabulary consisting of
“click” translates easily into “do the thing I want”. But this magic relies on
wanting a simple set of things, and having programs that can do exactly those things.</p>

<p>If you wish to do complex, purpose-specific things it helps to have a richer means
of expressing your instructions to the computer. It doesn’t need to be complicated or
difficult, just a vocabulary of commands and a simple grammar for using them.</p>

<p>This is what the shell provides - a simple language and a <strong>command-line interface</strong>
to use it through.</p>

<p>The heart of a command-line interface is a <strong>read-evaluate-print loop</strong> (REPL). It is called
so because when you type a command and press <kbd>Return</kbd> the shell
reads your command,
evaluates (or “executes”) it,
prints the output of your command,
loops back and waits for you to enter another command.</p>

<h3 id="the-shell">The Shell</h3>

<p>A shell is a program like any other.
What’s special about it is that its job is to run other programs
rather than to do calculations itself.
The most popular Unix shell is Bash,
the Bourne Again SHell
(so-called because it’s derived from a shell written by Stephen Bourne).
Bash is the default shell on most modern implementations of Unix
and in most packages that provide Unix-like tools for Windows.</p>

<h3 id="what-does-it-look-like">What does it look like?</h3>

<p>If you are working on a linux or Mac operating system you will have the luxury of a built in terminal.
For this course we will all be working on a remote linux server <strong>jen</strong> which is part of the Paulsen Research group
High Performance Computing Infrastructure.</p>

<p>In order to log into <strong>jen</strong> you will be given a username, password and the address of the servers
which will allow you to login using a secure shell (ssh) connection using the Mac or Linux terminal or
the windows mobaxterm interface.</p>

<p>Keep your login details secure. You will need to collect your login details in person during Friday class or from
4WW 336.</p>

<p>Once you login to your account you will find the raw sequence files from the mystery metagenome
that you will be assembling, annotating, describing and interpreting. The following four episodes
(which are part of the Software Carpentry lesson ‘Introducing the Shell’ will help familiarise
you with the Shell environment and introduce you to some of the tools needed for your first
assessment.</p>

<p>A typical shell window looks something like:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>yourname@jen:/disks/jen/data/mres/yourname$
yourname@jen:/disks/jen/data/mres/yourname$ ls -F /
Applications/         System/
Library/              Users/
Network/              Volumes/
yourname@jen:/disks/jen/data/mres/yourname$
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first line shows only a <strong>prompt</strong>,
indicating that the shell is waiting for input.
Your shell may use different text for the prompt. Most importantly:
when typing commands, either from these lessons or from other sources,
<em>do not type the prompt</em>, only the commands that follow it.</p>

<p>The part that you type,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">ls -F /</code> in the second line of the example,
typically has the following structure: a <strong>command</strong>,
some <strong>flags</strong> (also called <strong>options</strong> or <strong>switches</strong>) and an <strong>argument</strong>.
Flags start with a single dash (<code class="highlighter-rouge">-</code>) or two dashes (<code class="highlighter-rouge">--</code>), and change the behaviour of a command.
Arguments tell the command what to operate on (e.g. files and directories).
Sometimes flags and arguments are referred to as parameters.
A command can be called with more than one flag and more than one argument: but a
command doesn’t always require an argument or a flag.</p>

<p>In the second line of the example above, our <strong>command</strong> is <code class="highlighter-rouge">ls</code>, with a <strong>flag</strong> <code class="highlighter-rouge">-F</code> and an
<strong>argument</strong> <code class="highlighter-rouge">/</code>. Each part is separated by spaces: if you omit the space
between <code class="highlighter-rouge">ls</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">-F</code> the shell will look for a command called <code class="highlighter-rouge">ls-F</code>, which
doesn’t exist. Also, capitalization matters: <code class="highlighter-rouge">LS</code> is different to <code class="highlighter-rouge">ls</code>.</p>

<p>Next we see the output that our command produced. In this case it is a listing
of files and folders in a location called <code class="highlighter-rouge">/</code> - we’ll cover what all these mean
later today. Those using a macOS might recognize the output in this example.</p>

<p>Finally, the shell again prints the prompt and waits for you to type the next
command.</p>

<p>In the examples for this lesson, we’ll show the prompt as <code class="highlighter-rouge">$ </code>. You can make your
prompt look the same by entering the command <code class="highlighter-rouge">PS1='$ '</code>. But you can also leave
your prompt as it is - often the prompt includes useful information about who and where
you are.</p>

<p>Open a shell window and try entering <code class="highlighter-rouge">ls -F /</code> for yourself (don’t forget that spaces
and capitalization are important!). You can change the prompt too, if you like.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-the-shell-know-what-ls-and-its-flags-mean">How does the shell know what <code class="highlighter-rouge">ls</code> and its flags mean?</h3>

<p>Every command is a program stored somewhere on the computer, and the shell keeps a
list of places to search for commands (the list is in a <strong>variable</strong> called <code class="highlighter-rouge">PATH</code>,
but those are concepts we’ll meet later and are not too important at the moment). Recall
that commands, flags and arguments are separated by spaces.</p>

<p>So let’s look at the REPL (read-evaluate-print loop) in more detail. Notice that the
“evaluate” step is made of two parts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Read what was typed (<code class="highlighter-rouge">ls -F /</code> in our example)
 The shell uses the spaces to split the line into the command, flags, and arguments</li>
  <li>Evaluate:
 a. Find a program called <code class="highlighter-rouge">ls</code>
 b. Execute it, passing it the flags and arguments (<code class="highlighter-rouge">-F</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">/</code>) to
    interpret as the program sees fit</li>
  <li>Print the output produced by the program</li>
</ol>

<p>and then print the prompt and wait for you to enter another command.</p>

<blockquote class="callout">
  <h2 id="command-not-found">Command not found</h2>
  <p>If the shell can’t find a program whose name is the command you typed, it
will print an erorr message like:</p>

  <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>ls-F
</code></pre></div>  </div>
  <div class="output highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>-bash: ls-F: command not found
</code></pre></div>  </div>

  <p>Usually this means that you have mis-typed the command - in this case we omitted
the space between <code class="highlighter-rouge">ls</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">-F</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="is-it-difficult">Is it difficult?</h3>

<p>It is a different model of interacting than a GUI, and that
will take some effort - and some time - to learn. A GUI
presents you with choices and you select one. With a <strong>command line interface</strong> (CLI) the choices are combinations
of commands and parameters, more like words in a language than buttons on a screen. They
are not presented to you so
you must learn a few, like learning some vocabulary in a new language. But a small
number of commands gets you a long way, and we’ll cover those essential few today.</p>

<h3 id="flexibility-and-automation">Flexibility and automation</h3>

<p>The grammar of a shell allows you to combine existing tools into powerful
pipelines and handle large volumes of data automatically. Sequences of
commands can be written into a <em>script</em>, improving the reproducibility of
workflows and allowing you to repeat them easily.</p>

<p>In addition, the command line is often the easiest way to interact with remote machines and supercomputers.
Familiarity with the shell is near essential to run a variety of specialized tools and resources
including high-performance computing systems.
As clusters and cloud computing systems become more popular for scientific data crunching,
being able to interact with the shell is becoming a necessary skill.
We can build on the command-line skills covered here
to tackle a wide range of scientific questions and computational challenges.</p>

<h2 id="your-pipeline-starting-point">Your Pipeline: Starting Point</h2>

<p>You mission is to analyse metagenomics data generated from a mystery sample and provide evidence to suggest a likely source. The data was generated
using targetted and random approaches and Next Generation Sequencing technology. You will need to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Describe the size and quality of each component dataset,
plan an analysis workflow for each of the different types of data,
apply appropriate quality filtering techniques before assembly or clustering,
use methods to cluster or bin the assembled data,
Annotate and characterise the identity, and potential function of individual genes,
genomes and species found in the data and analyse the data collectively to infer the
likely source of the sample.</li>
  <li>Systematically collect evidence to support your conclusions and test hypotheses using a range of relevant tools and databases with reference to the different taxa, adaptations and metabolic functions found in your dataset</li>
  <li>Present your conclusions to the class as part of a presentation</li>
</ol>

<p>Metagenomics projects often involve sequencing and comparative analyses of many, many samples. For example,
the Marine Microbes Project has collected over 5,000 community profiles into a central database, with each set of sequences contained in separate multiple files.
Each raw sequence file contains on average 20,000-100,000 sequences, which all require quality checking, trimming and classification.</p>

<p>The bad news is that if you had to do this by hand, and process each and every sequence through the web interface for NCBI, you’ll be here for a while.
As an exercise, time how long it takes to BLAST a sequence through the NCBI interface, and then multiply the time taken to get a result by 20,000.</p>

<p>The whole process will take more than 14 days (with no sleep) for one small amplicon dataset. Looks like you will be postponing your graduation…</p>

<p>The next few lessons will explore what we should do instead.
More specifically,
they explain how we can use a command shell
to automate the repetitive steps in our processing pipeline
so that our computer can work 24 hours a day while we write the paper (and do other cool stuff that scientists need to do, like drink coffee, iron our labcoats, do field work, educate the public, save the world…)
As a bonus,
once we have put a processing pipeline together,
we will be able to use it again whenever we collect more data.</p>
